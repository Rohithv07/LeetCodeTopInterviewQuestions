Geek and his classmates are playing a prank on their Computer Science teacher. They change places every time the teacher turns to look at the blackboard. 

Each of the N students in the class can be identified by a unique roll number X and each desk has a number i associated with it. Only one student can sit on one desk. 
Each time the teacher turns her back, a student with roll number X sitting on desk number i gets up and takes the place of the student with roll number i.

If the current position of N students in the class is given to you in an array, such that i is the desk number and a[i] is the roll number of the student sitting on the desk, can you modify a[ ] to represent the next position of all the students ? 


Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
a[] = {0, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3}
Output: 0 3 5 1 4 2
Explanation: After reshuffling, the modified 
position of all the students would be 
{0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2}.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
a[] = {4, 3, 2, 1, 0}
Output: 0 1 2 3 4 
Explanation: After reshuffling, the modified 
position of all the students would be 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function prank() which takes the array a[ ] and its size N as input parameters and modifies the array in-place to reflect the new arrangement.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1

class Solution 
{ 
    void prank(long[] a, int n)  
    { 
        // code here
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = (a[i] + ((a[(int)a[i]] % n) * n));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] /= n;
        }
    }
