Given an adjacency matrix representation of an unweighted undirected graph named graph, which has N vertices. You have to find out if there is an eulerian path present in the graph or not.
Note: The graph consists of a single component

Example 1:

Input: N = 5
graph = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 1}, 
         {1, 0, 1, 1, 0}, 
         {0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, 
         {0, 1, 1, 0, 0}, 
         {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}}
Output: 1
Explaination: There is an eulerian path. 
The path is 5->1->2->4->3->2.
Example 2:

Input: N = 5
graph = {{0, 1, 0, 1, 1}, 
         {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}, 
         {0, 1, 0, 1, 1}, 
         {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}, 
         {1, 0, 1, 0, 0}}
Output: 0
Explaination: There is no eulerian path in 
the graph.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function eulerPath() which takes N and graph as input parameters and returns 1 if there is an eulerian path. Otherwise returns 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50 



// Every node must have even number of edges. 
// If there is any odd edged vertex then there will be 2 odd edged 
// vertices. Otherwise there is no eulerian path.

class Solution{
    static int eulerPath(int n, int graph[][]){
        // code here
        int count = 0;
        for (int [] g : graph) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int vertices : g) {
                sum += vertices;
            }
            if (sum % 2 != 0) {
                count++;
            }
            if (count > 2) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return 1 - count % 2;
    }
}
