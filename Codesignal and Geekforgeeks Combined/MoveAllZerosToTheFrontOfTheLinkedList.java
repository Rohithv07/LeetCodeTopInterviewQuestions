Given a linked list, the task is to move all 0â€™s to the front of the linked list. The order of all another element except 0 should be same after rearrangement.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the Linked List and the second line contains N-space separated integer inputs i.e. elements in the Linked List.

Output:
For each test case, the output is the modified linked list having all 0's in front.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function moveZeroes() which should move all the 0's to the front of the list.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 50
Note: List is from back to front.

Example:
Input:
2
10
0 1 0 1 2 0 5 0 4 0
7
0 0 0 3 2 1 1

Output:
0 0 0 0 0 4 5 2 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 2 3

Explanation:
1. Original list was 0->4->0->5->0->2->1->0->1->0->NULL.
     After processing list becomes 0->0->0->0->0->4->5->2->1->1->NULL.
2. Original list was 1->1->2->3->0->0->0->NULL.
    After processing list becomes 0->0->0->1->1->2->3->NULL.
