Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in l, and O(1) additional space complexity, since this is what you would be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Given a linked list l, reverse its nodes k at a time and return the modified list. k is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of l. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left out at the end should remain as-is.

You may not alter the values in the nodes - only the nodes themselves can be changed.

Example

For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the output should be
reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k) = [2, 1, 4, 3, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 1, the output should be
reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and k = 3, the output should be
reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k) = [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10, 11].







Solution:


# Singly-linked lists are already defined with this interface:
# class ListNode(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.next = None
#
def reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k):
     # Check if we need to reverse the group
        curr = l
        for _ in range(k):
            if not curr: return l
            curr = curr.next
		        
				
        # Reverse the group (basic way to reverse linked list)
        prev = None
        curr = l
        for _ in range(k):
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt
        
		
        # After reverse, we know that `head` is the tail of the group.
		# And `curr` is the next pointer in original linked list order
        l.next = reverseNodesInKGroups(curr, k)
        return prev
