Note: Your solution should have only one BST traversal and O(1) extra space complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

A tree is considered a binary search tree (BST) if for each of its nodes the following is true:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and the right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Given a binary search tree t, find the kth smallest element in it.

Note that kth smallest element means kth element in increasing order. See examples for better understanding.

Example

For

t = {
    "value": 3,
    "left": {
        "value": 1,
        "left": null,
        "right": null
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 5,
        "left": {
            "value": 4,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 6,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        }
    }
}
and k = 4, the output should be
kthSmallestInBST(t, k) = 5.

Here is what t looks like:

   3
 /   \
1     5
     / \
    4   6
The values of t are [1, 3, 4, 5, 6], and the 4th smallest is 5.

For

t = {
    "value": 1,
    "left": {
        "value": -1,
        "left": {
            "value": -2,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 0,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        }
    },
    "right": null
}

and k = 1, the output should be
kthSmallestInBST(t, k) = -2.

Here is what t looks like:

     1
    /
  -1
  / \
-2   0
The values of t are [-2, -1, 0, 1], and the 1st smallest is -2.

Solution:

//
// Binary trees are already defined with this interface:
// class Tree<T> {
//   Tree(T x) {
//     value = x;
//   }
//   T value;
//   Tree<T> left;
//   Tree<T> right;
// }
int kthSmallestInBST(Tree<Integer> t, int k) {
    Stack<Tree> stack = new Stack();
    int result = -1;
    int count = 0;
    while(count != k){
        while(t != null){
            stack.push(t);
            t = t.left;
        }
        t = stack.pop();
        result = t.value;
        count += 1;
        t = t.right;
    }
    return result;
}
