Given a singly linked list, the task is to rearrange it in a way that all odd position nodes are together and all even positions node are together.
Assume the first element to be at position 1 followed by second element at position 2 and so on.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4
Output: 1 3 2 4 
Explanation: 
Odd elements are 1, 3 and even elements are 
2, 4. Hence, resultant linked list is 
1->3->2->4.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 1 3 5 2 4 
Explanation: 
Odd elements are 1, 3, 5 and even elements are
2, 4. Hence, resultant linked list is
â€‹1->3->5->2->4.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function rearrangeEvenOdd() which rearranges the nodes in the linked list as required and doesn't return anything.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Size of the linked list <= 10000
1 <= values of linked list<= 1000


/*

class Node {

    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int d) {
        data = d;
        next = null;
    }
}
This is method only submission.
You only need to complete the below method.

class Solution
{

   // Should rearrange given linked list such that all even
   // positioned Nodes are before odd positioned.
   // Returns nothing
    void rearrangeEvenOdd(Node head)
    {
          //  The task is to complete this method
          if (head == null)
            return;
        Node odd = head;
        Node even = head.next;
        Node evenHead = even;
        while (even != null && even.next != null) {
            odd.next = even.next;
            odd = odd.next;
            even.next = odd.next;
            even = even.next;
        }
        odd.next = evenHead;
     }  
}
