Write a program to Validate an IPv4 Address. According to Wikipedia, IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1 . The generalized form of an IPv4 address is (0-255).(0-255).(0-255).(0-255). Here we are considering numbers only from 0 to 255 and any additional leading zeroes will be considered invalid.

Your task is  to complete the function isValid which returns 1 if the ip address is valid else returns 0. The function takes a string s as its only argument .

Example 1:

Input:
ip = 222.111.111.111
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input:
ip = 5555..555
Output: 0
Explanation: 5555..555 is not a valid
ip address, as the middle two portions
are missing.
Your Task:
Complete the function isValid() which takes the string s as an input parameter and returns 1 if this is a valid ip address otherwise returns 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N), N = length of string.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<=length of string <=50

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.




def isValid(s):
    #code here
    if s.count('.') != 3:
        return 0
    s1 = s.split('.')
    for i in s1:
        if not i.isdigit() or int(i) < 0 or int(i) > 255 or (i[0] == '0' and len(i) != 1):
            return 0
    return 1
