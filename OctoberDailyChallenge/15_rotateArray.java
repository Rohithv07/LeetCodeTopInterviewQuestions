Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k = k % nums.length;
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length-1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k-1);
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length-1);
    }
    public void reverse(int [] nums, int low, int high) {
        while (low < high) {
            int temp = nums[low];
            nums[low] = nums[high];
            nums[high] = temp;
            low += 1;
            high -= 1;
        }
    }
}
