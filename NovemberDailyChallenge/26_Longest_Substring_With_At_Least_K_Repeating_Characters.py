Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is less than or equal to k.Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105


class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        for c in set(s):
            if s.count(c) < k:
                return max(self.longestSubstring(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
        return len(s);
