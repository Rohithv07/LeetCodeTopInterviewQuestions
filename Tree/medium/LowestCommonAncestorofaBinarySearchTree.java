Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
  
    /*Code of this problem.*/

 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root==null){
            return null;
        }
        if(root.val<p.val && root.val<q.val){
           return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q);
        }
        if(root.val>p.val && root.val>q.val){
           return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q);
        }
        return root;
        
        
    }
}
