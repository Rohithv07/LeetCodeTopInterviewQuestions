Given the radius and x-y positions of the center of a circle, write a function randPoint which generates a uniform random point in the circle.

Note:

input and output values are in floating-point.
radius and x-y position of the center of the circle is passed into the class constructor.
a point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle.
randPoint returns a size 2 array containing x-position and y-position of the random point, in that order.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","randPoint","randPoint","randPoint"]
[[1,0,0],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,[-0.72939,-0.65505],[-0.78502,-0.28626],[-0.83119,-0.19803]]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","randPoint","randPoint","randPoint"]
[[10,5,-7.5],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,[11.52438,-8.33273],[2.46992,-16.21705],[11.13430,-12.42337]]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has three arguments, the radius, x-position of the center, and y-position of the center of the circle. randPoint has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.




class Solution {
    private double radius;
    private double x_center;
    private double y_center;
    public Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) {
        this.radius = radius;
        this.x_center = x_center;
        this.y_center = y_center;
    }
    
    public double[] randPoint() {
        double length = Math.sqrt(Math.random()) * radius;
        double degree = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
        double x = x_center + length * Math.cos(degree);
        double y = y_center + length * Math.sin(degree);
        return new double [] {x, y};
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(radius, x_center, y_center);
 * double[] param_1 = obj.randPoint();
