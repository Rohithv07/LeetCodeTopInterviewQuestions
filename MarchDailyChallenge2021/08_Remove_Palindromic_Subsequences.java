Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
Example 2:

Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
Example 3:

Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
s only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'



class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        if (s.length() == 0)
            return 0;
        if (s.length() == 1 || isPalindrome(s))
            return 1;
        return 2;
    }
    
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right))
                return false;
            left += 1;
            right -= 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
