Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 

Constraints:

0 <= low <= high <= 10^9


class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int count = (high - low) / 2;
        if (low % 2 != 0 || high % 2 != 0) {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
