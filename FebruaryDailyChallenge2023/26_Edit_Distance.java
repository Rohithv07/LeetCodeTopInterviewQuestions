Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
 

Constraints:

0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.


class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int length1 = word1.length();
        int length2 = word2.length();
        int [][] dp = new int [length1 + 1][length2 + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= length1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= length2; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = j;
                }
                else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = i;
                }
                else if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], Math.min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[length1][length2];
    }
}
