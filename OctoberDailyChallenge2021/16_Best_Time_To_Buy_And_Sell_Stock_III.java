You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
Example 4:

Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 105

        int length = prices.length;
        int [][] dp = new int [3][length];
        for (int i=0; i<=2; i++) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];

                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], maxDiff + prices[j]);
                    maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[2][length - 1];
