Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

 

Example 1:

Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:

Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
 

Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 2 * 104
0 <= data[i] <= 255



class Solution {
  public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {

    // Number of bytes in the current UTF-8 character
    int numberOfBytesToProcess = 0;

    // For each integer in the data array.
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {

      // Get the binary representation. We only need the least significant 8 bits
      // for any given number.
      String binRep = Integer.toBinaryString(data[i]);
      binRep =
          binRep.length() >= 8
              ? binRep.substring(binRep.length() - 8)
              : "00000000".substring(binRep.length() % 8) + binRep;

      // If this is the case then we are to start processing a new UTF-8 character.
      if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {

        // Get the number of 1s in the beginning of the string.
        for (int j = 0; j < binRep.length(); j++) {

            break;
          }

          numberOfBytesToProcess += 1;
        }

        // 1 byte characters
        if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {
          continue;
        }

        // Invalid scenarios according to the rules of the problem.
        if (numberOfBytesToProcess > 4 || numberOfBytesToProcess == 1) {
          return false;
        }

      } else {

        // Else, we are processing integers which represent bytes which are a part of
        // a UTF-8 character. So, they must adhere to the pattern `10xxxxxx`.
        if (!(binRep.charAt(0) == '1' && binRep.charAt(1) == '0')) {
          return false;
        }
      }

      // We reduce the number of bytes to process by 1 after each integer.
      numberOfBytesToProcess -= 1;
    }

    // This is for the case where we might not have the complete data for
    // a particular UTF-8 character.
    return numberOfBytesToProcess == 0;
