Given an array of integers A, We need to sort the array performing a series of pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 0 <= k < A.length.
Reverse the sub-array A[0...k].
For example, if A = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 2, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so A = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 2.

Return an array of the k-values of the pancake flips that should be performed in order to sort A. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * A.length flips will be judged as correct.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
Notice that we return an array of the chosen k values of the pancake flips.
Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
 

Constraints:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= A.length
All integers in A are unique (i.e. A is a permutation of the integers from 1 to A.length).

Solution:

class Solution:
    def pancakeSort(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        end = len(A)
        for i in range(end, 0, -1):
            index = A.index(i)
            result.extend([index+1, i])
            A = A[:index:-1] + A[:index]
        return result
