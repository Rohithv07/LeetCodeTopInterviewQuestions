Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104


class Solution {
    public int[] sortArray(int[] nums) {
        // quick sort is the way how to do this problem without inbuilt function
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums;
    }
}
